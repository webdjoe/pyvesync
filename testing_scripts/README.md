   ```bash
   pip install git+https://github.com/webdjoe/pyvesync.git@dev
   ```

4. Download the `vs_console_script.py` file from the `testing_scripts` directory of the repository and place it in your current directory using a browser or `wget`/`curl` command:

   ```bash
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webdjoe/pyvesync/dev/testing_scripts/vs_console_script.py

    ```

### Running in VS Code or other IDE's

The script can be run directly in an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Open the `vs_console_script.py` file and edit the `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` variables at the top of the file with your VeSync account credentials, along with any other . Then run the script using the IDE's debug command.

## Configuration

**WARNING**: The script will try to return the device to original state after testing, but it is not guaranteed to restore all states.

You can configure the script by modifying the following variables in the `vs_console_script.py` file:

- `USERNAME`: Your VeSync account email.
- `PASSWORD`: Your VeSync account password.
- `TEST_DEVICES`: Set to `True` to test device functionality.
- `TEST_TIMERS`: Set to `True` to test timer functionality.
- `OUTPUT_FILE`: Path to the output file for logging.
- `TEST_DEV_TYPE`: Specific device type to test (Options are  "bulbs", "switchs", "outlets", "humidifiers", "air_purifiers", "fans").

CONFIGURING VIA COMMAND LINE:

You can also configure the script via command line arguments:

```bash
python vs_test_script.py \  # or testing_scripts/vs_test_script.py if using repository method
   --email <your_email> \
   --password <your_password> \
   --test-devices \  # Include device methods in the test
   --test-timers \  # Include timer methods in the test
   --output-file <output_file> \
   --test-dev-type <device_type> # Options: "bulbs", "switchs", "outlets", "humidifiers", "air_purifiers", "fans"
```
